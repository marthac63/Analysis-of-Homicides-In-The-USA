# Analysis-of-Homicides-In-The-USA

Homicide rates in the USA are frequently amoungst the highest in the Western World. 
Why is this? Is it related to times of economic downturn? Is it the relaxed gun laws that the USA is so well known for? Can we identify some trends?

The dataset I am using is here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/murderaccountability/homicide-reports
The Murder Accountability Project is the most complete database of homicides in the United States currently available. This dataset includes murders from the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Report from 1976 to the present and Freedom of Information Act data on more than 22,000 homicides that were not reported to the Justice Department. This dataset includes the age, race, sex, ethnicity of victims and perpetrators, in addition to the relationship between the victim and perpetrator and weapon used.

I have done some data cleaning and preliminary analysis which can be seen in the Jupyter notebook, and I have then done some more EDA and visualizations to identify any trends in Tableau which can be seen here:
